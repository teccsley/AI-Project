# AI-Driven Threat Detection System

I am developing software that uses AI to detect and analyze potential security threats in real-time. As of September 22, 2024, I will use Java, SQL, and Python. I am new to this so I will make mistakes so feel free to teach me and help me improve.

# Features:

Using machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic patterns or user behavior to identify anomalies that could indicate a security breach. Implement natural language processing (NLP) to scan communications (like emails or chat logs) for phishing attempts or social engineering.

# Core Features:
Real-Time Analysis: These systems analyze data in real time, processing vast amounts of network traffic, user behaviors, and system logs to detect anomalies that might indicate a security threat.

Behavioral Analysis: By establishing a baseline of normal behavior for users and systems, AI can detect deviations that might indicate a threat, like unusual login times or access to sensitive data.

Predictive Analytics: Using historical data, AI systems can predict potential vulnerabilities or future attacks. This predictive capability helps in proactive defense rather than reactive measures.

Automated Response: Upon detecting a threat, AI systems can initiate automated responses, like isolating affected systems, blocking suspicious IP addresses, or escalating alerts to human analysts.

Scalability: AI-driven systems can scale to handle the increasing volume of data in large networks, making them suitable for big enterprises as well as growing businesses.

Learning and Adaptation: Machine learning models continuously learn from new data, improving their detection algorithms over time to adapt to new threats.

# Java for backend robustness, Python for AI/ML capabilities, and SQL for data management
